# Predicting Salaries Based on Recent Job Postings

## Introduction
Have you ever thought how salaries for certain jobs are determined?  These figures are not just randomly determined.  One would assume that type of degree, the type of skills, and the job industry are just some of the factors that determine salary.  In this project, I will analyze variables associated with current job postings and how they can (or cannot) affect the salary.
